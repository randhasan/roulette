 // CHS CS 0401
 // Assignment 3 List Test Program
 // You should complete the RPList class such that this program will compile
 // and execute correctly, with output similar to that shown in file 
 // A3ListTest.txt.  See extensive comments about the various required methods
 // and functionality of the RPList class.
 //
 // Important Note:  This program will modify the contents of file players.txt.
 // The trace output of this program in file A3ListTest.txt shows two runs executed
 // in sequence -- be sure to run yours twice when testing it.  Also be sure to copy
 // the players.txt file to a temp file before running this program.  That way you 
 // can restore it to the original before submitting.  You should submit this program
 // with the original, provided version of players.txt.
